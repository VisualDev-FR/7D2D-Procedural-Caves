    ☐ Optimization: disable surface meshes (which are not cave entrances) when player is underground
    ☐ Optimization: free cavemap memory after saving it, after game exit
    ☐ Optimization: Refactor GetSphere to handle RLE layers instead of blocks
    ☐ Optimization: multi thread or async reading of .tts files, to reduce time spent in prefabs spawning

    ☐ IO: store RLE layers instead of blocks

    ✔ horde triggers (like police car ?) @done(24-11-02 23:27)
    ✔ artifact collections, only complete collection sellable to trader @done(24-11-02 23:27)
