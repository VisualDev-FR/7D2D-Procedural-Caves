    ☐ editor: dedicated testing feature, to test how the cave system is builded around

    ☐ generation: increase ore layers width
    ☐ generation: debug tunnels intersections with surface prefabs
    ☐ generation: find an efficient way to add water in caves
    ☐ generation: implement multiple cave networks (good feature + performances hack)
    ☐ generation: set variant boolean attribute on cave prefab to avoid repetion with vanilla ones
    ☐ generation: allow cave markers inside poi bounds, combining octree cluster parsing + marker directions
    ☐ generation: allow tunneling inside rwg tiles
    ☐ generation: store terrain offset in worldinfos.xml
    ☐ generation: hidden treasures chests
    ☐ generation: add trapped sections on flat ground
    ☐ generation: fix floating blocks at tunnels intersections

    ☐ decoration: setup water decoration
    ☐ decoration: broken bikes or else mechanical stuff to gather mechanical parts, etc...
    ☐ decoration: lights to turn on

    ☐ UI: setup rwg user interface
    ☐ UI: Loading screen with cave pictures

    ✔ Optimization: store all sphere offsets to avoid computing sqrDistance in critical sections @done(24-09-10 22:16)
    ☐ Optimization: disable surface meshes (which are not cave entrances) when player is underground
    ☐ Optimization: work special vector3sbs(short, byte, short) class as long as possible in cave tunneling, avoiding instanciating caveBlocks
    ☐ Optimization: free cavemap memory after saving it, after game exit
    ☐ Optimization: handle cave regions loading / unloading

Later:
    ✘ rare ore vein -> need custom microsplat @cancelled(24-11-02 23:26)

    ✔ horde triggers (like police car ?) @done(24-11-02 23:27)
    ✔ artifact collections, only complete collection sellable to trader @done(24-11-02 23:27)
