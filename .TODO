Priority:
    ✘ implement tunneling with code of toolTerrainModelder @cancelled(24-08-29 21:59)
    ✔ debug cave prefab placements regarding surface prefabs @done(24-08-17 22:43)

    ✔ implement prefab rename command in cave editor plugin @done(24-08-18 22:22)
    ✔ Implement custom wilderness prefab spawning function @done(24-08-23 21:41)
    ✔ implement intersection detection inside rwg tiles @done(24-08-29 21:58)
    ✔ check cave horde nights @done(24-09-06 19:00)
    ✔ find an efficient way to check if a path exists between two cave blocks (for zombie spawning) @done(24-09-07 22:33)

    ☐ debug tunnels intersections with surface prefabs
    ☐ reduce water spawns with a noise map
    ☐ setup water decoration
    ☐ attemps to add trapped terrain blocks
    ☐ setup cave biomes (radiated, spores, water, else ?)
    ☐ assert abs(prefab.yOffset) < prefab.size.y
    ☐ integrate small prefabs in tunnels (dirt, decoration, modeled terrain, stalactites, water well)
    ☐ implement multiple cave networks (good feature + performances hack)
    ☐ find a way to force rwg POIs choices
    ☐ implement tunnel terrain smoothing
    ☐ setup rwg user interface
    ☐ implmement ore layers
    ☐ Increase terrain heightmap
    ☐ set variant boolean attribute on cave prefab to avoid repetion with vanilla ones

Optimization:
    ☐ work special vector3sbs(short, byte, short) class as long as possible in cave tunneling, avoiding instanciating caveBlocks
    ☐ free cavemap memory after saving it, after game exit
    ☐ store all sphere offsets to avoid computing sqrDistance in critical sections
        * one array with offsets of the bigger sphere
        * another array containing indexes to pick for other diameters

Testing:
    ☐ block inside cave prefabs must be cave air (H_Prefab.cs)
    ☐ cluterization of prefabs where size.x != size.z

Bug:
    ✔ can't place torch inside caveAir @done(24-09-06 19:38)
    ☐ floating blocks at tunnels intersections
    ☐ man in terrain (bugged decoration)
    ☐ caveAir are displayed in black on the map

Cave generation:
    ✔ random pois placement @done(24-08-15 22:38)
    ✔ cave decoration @done(24-08-15 22:38)
    ✔ poi placement system @done(24-08-15 22:38)
    ✔ cave entrance system @done(24-08-15 22:38)
    ✔ allow to cancel the generation @done(24-08-17 21:09)
    ☐ more procedural rooms
    ☐ natural fillers (rooms, mazes, canyon, rivers, tensionned stalactites, etc...)
    ☐ random world generator UI

Editor:
    ✔ replace selection by terrain / by stone helper @done(24-08-15 20:49)
    ✔ place cave marker from selection @done(24-08-15 20:49)
    ✔ suggest cave tags @done(24-08-15 20:49)
    ☐ check cave markers placement
    ☐ check min entrance deep
    ☐ fill selection with procedural terrain
    ☐ dedicated testing feature, to test how the cave system is builded around
    ☐ Add missing prefab names into localization.txt
    ☐ command to add entry in localization.txt

prefab themes:
    ☐ nest of creatures
    ☐ trapped tunnels which could be confused with regular ones
    ☐ pirate treasures

Later:
    ☐ special rope with stability + 360 degres climbable
    ☐ live cave map
    ☐ cave navigation with beacons
    ☐ random ropes (some of those are trapped ? with a dedicated sound when it breaks ?)
    ☐ sound ambiance
    ☐ possibility to choose which POIs to include or exlude, grouped by mod or else
    ☐ rare ore vein
    ☐ tunnels blocked with dirt
    ☐ hidden treasures
    ☐ obstacles to jumb over (with traps at the bottom ?)
    ☐ landslide event
    ☐ flooding event
    ☐ horde triggers (like police car ?)
    ☐ no oxygen event
    ☐ zombie toxic spore events (with particule effects like TLOS ?)
    ☐ radiation event
    ☐ cave fog
    ☐ artifact collections, only complete collection sellable to trader
    ☐ murals
    ☐ loot bioming
    ☐ new plants which grow in caves only
    ☐ mine structures (or else) along tunnels (via prefab parts ? make new cave parts group ?)
    ☐ tunnel treasure quest
    ☐ dedicated materials to explore caves (metal detector, gps, gazmask, nbc suit, flares, flare gun, ice axe)
    ☐ dedicated game settings tab in saves menu for cave gameplay
    ☐ broken bikes or else mechanical stuff to gather mechanical parts, etc...
    ☐ lights to turn on
    ☐ loot in niches dug into the walls or the floor

Cancelled:
    ✘ increase terrain height @cancelled(24-07-10 00:26)
    ✘ full region reset @cancelled(24-08-15 20:49)
    ✘ visitmap full -> commande à rouler pour générer toute la map -> voir dans le repertoire de sauvegarde de la partie @cancelled(24-08-15 20:49)
